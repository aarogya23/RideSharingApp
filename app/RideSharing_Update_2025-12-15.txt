Project: Ride Sharing Application

Today I worked on the backend and frontend integration for the ride-sharing application. The main updates and tasks I completed are:

1. Implemented PUT mapping in the React Native frontend to allow profile updates.
2. Updated the backend API to handle saving rides with:
   - Vehicle type
   - Route distance
   - Calculated price
   - Destination name
   - User location (latitude & longitude)
   - Destination location (latitude & longitude)
3. Modified the RideDto and Ridedestination model to include both user and destination coordinates.
4. Updated the RideController to save rides including all necessary location data.
5. Ensured proper validations for vehicle type, distance, and price before saving rides.
6. Connected the React Native frontend to send all ride details to the backend API.
7. Tested saving rides and verifying that both user and destination coordinates are properly stored in the database.

This update improves the ride-booking functionality by allowing accurate tracking and storing of both the user's current location and destination location, which will be useful for route calculation and driver assignment.
